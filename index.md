Welcome to the 4th incarnation of my blog. All previous incarnations have been nuked. If you're looking for my classics, use the Internet archive to dig for them. Eventually, when I find the time and inclination, I might revisit some old content and post and updated version here.

I'll be writing more actively and consistently this time. I will be using this blog as my _What I Learned This Week_ repository, and expect regular posts on these topics:

- DevOps
- RubyMotion
- Rails
- Architecture
- Entrepreneurship
